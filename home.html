          privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how your personal or behavioral data is collected, used, and
          stored when you access our website, the web application or mobile application (collectively the
          &ldquo;Site&rdquo;). We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time which will be indicated by changing
          the date at the top of this page. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email (sent to the
          email address specified in your account), by means of a notice on our Services prior to the change becoming
          effective, or as otherwise required by law. Your use of the Site is at all times subject to the GalaxyFinance
          User Agreement, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Privacy Policy without
          defining them have the definitions given to them in the GalaxyFinance User Agreement.</p>

        </ol>
        <p>By the Site, you signify acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy. Where we require your consent to
          process your information, we will ask for your consent to the collection and use of your information as
          described further below. We provide additional &quot;just-in-time&quot; disclosures or information about the
          data processing practices of specific services. These notices may supplement or clarify our privacy practices
          or may provide you with additional choices about how we process your data. If you do not agree with or you are
          not comfortable with any aspect of this Privacy Policy, you should immediately discontinue access or use of
          the Site. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence, you may use the Services
          only with the consent of or under the supervision of your parent or legal guardian. Consistent with the
          requirements of the Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), if we learn that we have received
          any information directly from a child under age 13 without first receiving his or her parent&apos;s verified
          consent, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or his or her parent or legal
          guardian) to inform the child that he or she cannot use the Site and subsequently we will delete that
          information.</p>

              your portfolio in real-time, but this information is not stored. Specifically, we trim timestamps on
              server logs to the hour, so cross-associating wallet data is not possible. If I have multiple wallets

        <p>For our mobile users, push notifications are slightly different because we rely on Apple and Google&rsquo;s
          push notification systems. In order to send notifications to a given wallet, we need to persistently store
          device tokens (an anonymized string) and the list of wallet addresses subscribed to notifications from that
          device. Anyone who wishes to avoid this data being stored entirely has the choice to disable push

          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of the Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we
          cannot guarantee complete security. The safety and security of your Personal Information also depends on you.
          Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user
          information at any time. Your Wallet is protected by your password, private key, and/or seed phrase, and we
          urge you to take steps to keep this and other Personal Information safe by not disclosing your security
          credentials or leaving your Wallet open in an unsecured manner. We further protect your Personal Information
          from potential security breaches by implementing certain technological security measures including encryption,
          firewalls, and secure socket layer technology. We also seek to protect Personal Information by refraining from
          collecting Personal Information where possible. However, these measures do not guarantee that your Personal
          Information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by a breach of such firewalls and secure
          server software. By using our Services, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.
          <br />
          WE DO NOT AND WILL NEVER STORE YOUR WALLET PASSWORD, PRIVATE KEY, OR SEED PHRASE TO YOUR WALLET. IF YOU LOSE
          ACCESS TO BOTH YOUR PASSWORD AND SEED PHRASE, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO HELP YOU ACCESS YOUR WALLET, AND ANY ASSETS
          HELD IN THE WALLET MAY BE PERMANENTLY IRRETRIEVABLE.
          <br />
          We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or
          delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.

          in accordance with this Policy. One such step we may take to ensure the security of your Personal Information
          in the event that a transfer may not be subject to the same protection in the EEA or Switzerland, is to enter

        <p>Under the CCPA, you may have the following consumer rights. Please note that these rights are not absolute
          and in certain cases are subject to conditions or limitations as specified in the CCPA:</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <ul>

            <p>● For personal information collected by us during the preceding 12 months preceding your request that is
              not otherwise subject to an exception, California residents have the right to access and delete their
              personal information. GalaxyFinance will not discriminate against those who exercise their rights.
              Specifically, if you exercise your rights, we will not deny you services, charge you different prices for
              services or provide you a different level or quality of services.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>● To the extent we sell your personal information to third parties, you also have the right to request
              that
              we disclose to you: (i) the categories of your personal information that we sold, and (ii) the categories
              of third parties to whom your personal information was sold. You have the right to direct us not to sell
              your personal information. GalaxyFinance does not sell your personal information in its ordinary course of
              business and will never sell your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent.</p>

        <p>Should GalaxyFinance engage in any of the activities listed in this section, your ability to exercise these
          rights will be made available to you in your account settings. You can exercise your rights by going to your
          Privacy Rights Dashboard or contacting us via our Support Portal so that we may consider your request. We will
          need to verify your identity before processing your request. In order to verify your identity, we will
          generally either require the successful login to your account or the matching of sufficient information you
          provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems. Although we try to limit the personal
          information collected in connection with a request to exercise your rights, certain requests may require us to
          obtain additional personal information from you. In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to
          exercise the right to know and right to deletion, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity.
        </p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>If you are a California resident, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request to access or a
          request to delete on your behalf. To do so, you must: (1) provide that authorized agent written and signed
          permission to submit such a request; and (2) verify your own identity directly with us. Please note, we may
          deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to
          act on your behalf. We will respond to your authorized agent&apos;s request if they submit proof that they are
          registered with the California Secretary of State to be able to act on your behalf, or submit evidence you
          have provided them with power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code section 4121 to 4130. We may
          deny requests from authorized agents who do not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on
          their behalf, or are unable to verify their identity.</p>

        <h3 class="font-bold font-20">Wallet Address, Private Key, and Backup Capabilities</h3>
        <p>An encrypted backup of certain information associated with your wallet can be stored on eligible devices. The
          private key is associated with the wallet address and, together, they can be used to authorize the transfer of
          Digital Assets to and from that wallet address. You are solely responsible for the retention and security of
          your private key and any mnemonic phrase (&ldquo;Secret Phrase&rdquo;) associated with your wallet. You must
          keep your wallet address, Secret Phrase, and private key access information secure. It is very important that
          you backup your private keys, backup phrases or passwords. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control
          of Digital Assets associated with your wallet. You acknowledge and agree that we do not receive or store your
          wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or Secret Phrase associated with your wallet.
          We cannot generate a new password for your wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have
          not safely stored a backup of any wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your wallet, you accept
          and acknowledge that any Digital Assets you have associated with such wallet address will become inaccessible.
          Accordingly, we shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever in the event you are unable to access
          your wallet for any reason including without limitation your failure to keep your wallet address, Secret
          Phrase and private key information secure.</p>

          associated with the node servers selected by you; (iv) when you use DApps or DEX, third-party developed Smart

          that occurs following the effective date of the updated fees.</p>
        <h3 class="font-bold font-20">Use of Staking Service</h3>
        <p>If you access or use the Staking Service, a third party may stake certain Digital Assets on your behalf
          (&ldquo;Staked Digital Assets&rdquo;), acting as a transaction validator on the applicable blockchain network.
          If a block of transactions is successfully validated using such Staked Digital Assets, a reward is granted by

          for: (i) your use of the Staking Service and shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with your use of
          the Staking Service; (ii) ensuring Staking will occur on a continuous basis; and (iii) ensuring any particular
          Digital Asset will be staked or will continue to be staked.</p>
        <h3 class="font-bold font-20">Buy Digital Assets with Supported Credit or Debit Cards</h3>
        <p>If you use GalaxyFinance to purchase Digital Assets with your credit or debit card, a third party will
          convert your chosen amount into the applicable Digital Asset and credit it to your wallet. You acknowledge and
          agree that: (i) GalaxyFinance is not responsible for your use of such third party service and shall have no

          any fees charged by the relevant third party service provider(s) or your bank or credit card issuer(s).</p>
        <h3 class="font-bold font-20">Digital Asset Transactions</h3>
        <p>In order for all proposed Digital Asset transactions to be completed, they must be confirmed and recorded in
          the Digital Assets associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks
          supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the
          blockchain networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via
          our Services will be confirmed and processed. By using GalaxyFinance, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) we
          do not have the ability to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction; (ii) the transaction details you
          submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the applicable blockchain networks; (iii) we
          do not store, send, or receive Digital Assets; and (iv) any transfer that occurs in relation to any Digital
          Asset occurs on the relevant blockchain network and not on a network owned by us and therefore we do not
          guarantee the transfer of title or right in any Digital Asset.</p>
        <h3 class="font-bold font-20">Accuracy of Information Provided by User</h3>
        <p>You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You
          accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection
          with any Digital Asset transaction initiated via the Services. We strongly encourage you to review your
          transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a Digital Asset.</p>
        <h2 class="font-bold font-22">WALLET REGISTRATION AND SECURITY</h2>
        <p>You must either import or create a wallet in order to use GalaxyFinance. When you create a wallet, you will
          be assigned a private key. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your private key or
          any other breach of security of your wallet. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that you
          shall assume all risks related to the use of the Services and you shall be solely responsible for maintaining
          the confidentiality and security of your private key. When you create a wallet, you are strongly advised to
          take precautions in order to avoid loss of access to and/or control over your wallet. Suggested measures
          include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) creating a strong unique password that you do not use for
          any other purpose (i.e. different to your phone password or any other passwords you use for websites, online
          services, etc.) and leveraging biometric authentication if available; (b) do not store the private key and
          Secret Phrase in plain text online or in an unsecured physical location; (c) limiting access to your devices

        <p>The Site uses cookies and similar technologies such as clear GIFs, JavaScript, and local storage. Cookies are
          small files &ndash; usually consisting of letters and numbers &ndash; placed on your computer, tablet, phone,

          technologies simply as&nbsp;&ldquo;Cookies&rdquo;&nbsp;for the remainder of this Cookie Policy. We use Cookies
          to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit and otherwise use the

        <p><br></p>
        <p>We may combine non-personally identifiable information collected through cookies with other Personal
          Information that we have about you, for example, to tell us whether you have a Wallet in use in our Services.
          We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties in
          order to enhance our Services, or to offer you information that we believe may be of interest to you. Where we
          use Cookies to collect information that is personally identifiable, or that can become personally identifiable
          if we combine it with other information, the Privacy Policy will apply in addition to this Cookie Policy.</p>

          each new cookie in a variety of ways. You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can
          set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust
          some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work. We strongly

        <p>These are cookies that are required to provide you with features or services that you have requested. For
          example, Cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our site or use a shopping cart. Disabling these

        <p><br></p>
        <p>Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Site such as by collecting
          information about the number of visitors to the Site, what pages visitors view on our Site, how long visitors
          are viewing pages on the Site, and other preferences of users of our Site. Performance/Analytical Cookies also

        <p><br></p>
        <p>Advertising Cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can
          provide advertising that we believe is relevant to you. These are typically in the form of Cookies placed by a
          third party on your device and may provide information to those third parties about browsing habits that may
          help identify if certain services that such third parties provide are being used, identify your interests,
          retarget you and serve advertisements that are relevant to you. We do not have control or access to such third
          party Cookies. If you look at one page on our Site, an advertisement may be delivered to you on our Site or on
          other sites, for products referenced on that page or for similar products and services. We do not engage in
          retargeted advertising for children users of our Site.</p>

          site. The length of time a persistent Cookie stays on your device varies from Cookie to Cookie. We use
          persistent Cookies to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit, and to keep a more
          accurate account of how often you visit our Site, how often you return, how your use of the Site may vary over
          time, and measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts. Through these Cookies, we may collect information
          about your online activity after you leave our Site. Just like any other usage information we collect, this
          information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience. Your browser may offer you
          a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications
          and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain
          of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; policy is
